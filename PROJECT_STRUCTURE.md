# Aether Web - Project Structure & Architecture

## Overview

Aether Web is a modern educational platform built with Next.js 14, featuring role-based authentication, dashboard management, and comprehensive UI components.

## Project Architecture

### üîê Security & Authentication

- **Student Dashboard** (`/dashboard/student`)
  - Class schedule and assignments
  - Grade tracking
  - Upcoming events
- **Editor Dashboard** (`/dashboard/editor`)
  - Content management interface
  - Publishing tools

### üîß API Routes & Security

#### Authentication Routes (`/api/auth/`)

- **`send-otp`** - Secure OTP generation and sending
- **`verify-otp`** - OTP verification with rate limiting
- **`signup`** - User registration with validation
- **`check-email`** - Email availability checking
- **`[...nextauth]`** - NextAuth.js configuration

#### Protected Routes

- **`/api/update-profile`** - User profile updates
- **`/api/verify-password`** - Password verification
- **`/api/attendance/[sessionId]`** - Attendance management
- **`/api/teacher/[id]`** - Teacher-specific data

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

#### API Protection

- **Input validation** using Zod schemas
- **Rate limiting** on sensitive endpoints
